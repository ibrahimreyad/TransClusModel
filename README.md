# TransClusModel: Transformer-Based Topic Modeling with Density-Based Clustering

TransClusModel is a topic modeling approach that combines pre-trained language models with density-based clustering methods like UMAP and HDBSCAN to improve topic coherence and document clustering. It is designed for handling large text datasets and provides flexibility in topic discovery.


## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repository-url>
   cd TransClusModel
   ```

2. Install required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

**Dependencies**:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Transformers library
- UMAP
- HDBSCAN
- Scikit-learn
- (List any other libraries you used)


## Data Preparation

TransClusModel works with various text datasets, such as Reuters-21578, 20 Newsgroups, and BBC News. Make sure the datasets are in a structured format (e.g., CSV or TXT) with one document per row. Preprocessing includes:
- Lowercasing text
- Tokenization
- Stop-word removal
- (Any other preprocessing steps)

- [20 Newsgroups](link-to-dataset)


## Usage

To start using TransClusModel, run the following command:
```bash
python main.py --dataset_path <path-to-dataset> --output_path <path-for-results>


Optional parameters:

--num_topics: Set the number of topics (default: 20)
--model: Specify the language model to use (e.g., "bert-base-uncased")
(List other parameters if applicable)
Example:

python main.py --dataset_path data/20newsgroups.csv --num_topics 15 --model "distilbert-base-uncased"


### 5. **Project Structure**
- Provide an overview of the main files and directories in the project. This helps users understand where to look for specific parts of the code.
```markdown
## Project Structure

- `main.py`: The main file for running TransClusModel.
- `preprocessing.py`: Contains functions for data cleaning and preprocessing.
- `model.py`: Defines the TransClusModel class and core functionality.
- `utils/`: Helper functions and utilities.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.


## Results and Evaluation

The results, including topic coherence scores and clustering metrics, will be saved in the specified output directory. Check the output files to review:
- Document-topic distributions
- Topic coherence scores
- Cluster visualizations


## Limitations

TransClusModel may have performance constraints on very large datasets due to memory requirements for clustering. Additionally, topic coherence can vary with different pre-trained models, so results may not be consistent across models.
